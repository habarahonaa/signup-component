## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vainilla JS for Form Validation
- SCSS - For styles

### Continued development

This challenge definitely tested my layout skills so perhaps lots of my code (specially SCSS) is not particularly DRY right now. Also, while I'm proud with the JS validation method, perhaps is not as interactive as I originally thought so thats definitely a point to improve.

### Useful resources

- [Better form submissions by Stephen C. Weiss](https://stephencharlesweiss.com/better-form-submissions-with-event-preventdefault-and-htmlformelement-reset/) - This helped me a lot to understand a way to stop the default behaviour of the form and properly run the validation function. Thanks!
- [How to get type of input field](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3510867/finding-the-type-of-an-input-element) - This is an amazing discussion that helped to get the type of an input field so I can run the proper validation function.
